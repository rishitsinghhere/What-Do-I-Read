# What-Do-I-Read
A web application developed as part of our semester project, designed to help users discover books across various genres.

The platform allows users to browse books by category, view detailed information, and save favorites to their personal profile. With secure user authentication, readers can create accounts, log in, and manage their saved collections seamlessly.

How it works:
